TODO

	1) add a static to the training pipe to create an initial model checkpoint
	2) as part of 1), implement the get_state() functions in each restorable member
	3) build out the rest of the training pipe, including the loop
	4) #3 includes ability to restore_state() to all restorable members
	this should conclude the pre-training pipeline and i'll just need to get to:
		writing some tests
		putting in hints as appropriate
		adding comments as appropriate
